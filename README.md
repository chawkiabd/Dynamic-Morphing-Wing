# Dynamic Morphing Wing CFD
This project contains the user-defined functions (UDF) necessary to perform unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of dynamically morphing wings equipped with morphing flaps.

There are three UDFs for each of the following applications:
1.	2D Downward Dynamic Morphing Flap
2.	2D Downward Dynamic Morphing Flap
3.	3D Morphing Wing with Seamless Side-edge Transition

## Prerequisites
The UDFs were specifically developed and tested for ANSYS Fluent 18.1 and above, there is backward compatibility although some differences might be present in the building and compiling process within ANSYS Fluent.


Make sure that a proper compiler is installed on the machine, Visual Studio 2012 for instance, and the environment variables are set accordingly.
