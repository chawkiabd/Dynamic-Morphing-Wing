# Dynamic-Morphing-Wing
This project contains the necessary user-defined functions necessary to perform unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of dynamically morphing wings equipped with morphing flaps.

There are three UDFs for each of the following applications:
1.	2D Downward Dynamic Morphing Flap
2.	2D Downward Dynamic Morphing Flap
3.	3D Morphing Wing with Seamless Side-edge Transition
